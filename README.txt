Hi, my name's James Morgan. My username on slack is MorganJay. I was previously in the start.ng program and I look forward to what I can learn and accomplish in this remote internship.
My goal is to become a fullstack developer so I registered for both Front and Backend tracks, with HTML/CSS/JS and C# and Python languages respectively.
However, I have always been more inclined to Backend Dev and I discovered I could only pick one track in HNGi7 hence, i selected backend.
